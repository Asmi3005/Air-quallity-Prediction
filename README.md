# Air Quality Prediction ðŸŒŽâœ¨

## overview
Air pollution is a growing concern, posing risks to health and the environment. This project utilizes machine learning to predict air quality levels based on a dataset containing pollutant concentrations (PM2.5, PM10, NOx, CO, etc.)
and the Air Quality Index (AQI). By preprocessing data, analyzing features, and applying predictive models, the study aims to accurately classify air quality, enablingproactive measures for pollution management 
and public safety.

##Features
- Implements data preprocessing, feature selection, and model training.  
- Visualizes air quality trends with graphs and charts.

## Project Workflow 

1. **Data Collection and Visualization**:  
   Load and explore the air quality dataset to understand its structure and key attributes.

2. **Data Cleaning**:  
   Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and address outliers to ensure data quality.

3. **Feature Engineering**:  
   Select and transform relevant features for building the prediction model.

4. **Model Building**:  
   Train machine learning models such as:  
   - Linear Regression
   - Lasso Regression
   - Ridge Regression
   - Decision Tree Regressor
   - Random Forest Regressor
   - K-Nearest Neighbours Regression

5. **Evaluation**:  
   Assess the model's performance using metrics like:  
   - RÂ² (Coefficient of Determination)  
   - RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
